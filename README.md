# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage is intended to allow bootcamp students to easily review notes on the content covered in the prework modules. By categorizing content, creating visual appeal and adding functionality, this webpage should serve as a resource to reduce the stress associated with studying. In creating this webpage, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.
